The 256 game.

### Rules
Just like 2048, but simpler.  
You'll have to choose a place to set up the new tile 2, and then use wasd, the arrow keys, or swipe to move the map towards a certain direction. And then... Loop, until you cannot move anymore. If you (maybe once) reached all of the target number(s), then you win!
